    <h1>PML Prediction Assignment Writeup</h1>
    <p>This report documents the steps and findings from a predictive modeling exercise conducted as part of the Practical Machine Learning (PML) course. The objective was to develop and evaluate machine learning models that predict outcomes based on the dataset provided.</p>

    <h2>1. Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains observations across several variables, representing various features of interest. The main goal was to predict a target variable based on these features. Below is a summary of key variables:</p>

   <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Variable</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Type</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>age</td>
                <td>Age of the individuals</td>
                <td>Numeric</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>income</td>
                <td>Annual income in USD</td>
                <td>Numeric</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>gender</td>
                <td>Gender of the individuals</td>
                <td>Categorical</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>2. Summary Statistics</h2>
    <p>The following are the key summary statistics for the numeric variables in the dataset:</p>

    <pre>
age:
  Min.   : 18
  Median : 35
  Mean   : 37.5
  Max.   : 65

income:
  Min.   : 20,000
  Median : 50,000
  Mean   : 54,300
  Max.   : 150,000
    </pre>

    <h2>3. Visualizations</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Age Distribution</h3>
    <p>The age distribution shows a concentration of individuals in the 25-45 age range, as visualized below:</p>

    <h3>3.2 Income by Gender</h3>
    <p>The box plot below illustrates income distribution by gender, highlighting potential differences:</p>

    <h2>4. Insights and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Based on the analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The majority of individuals are within the 25-45 age range.</li>
        <li>Income tends to be higher for individuals above the median age.</li>
        <li>There are observable variations in income distribution by gender.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further analysis could focus on understanding the relationship between income and other demographic variables.</p>

    <h2>5. Insights and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Based on the analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Random Forest model outperformed the others in terms of accuracy and precision.</li>
        <li>Gradient Boosting also performed well but had slightly lower recall.</li>
        <li>Logistic Regression, while simpler, had the lowest overall performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Future work could involve fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring additional algorithms to further improve prediction accuracy.</p>
